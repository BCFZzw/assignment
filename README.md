# QLS600 reproducibility assignment

Reproducibility / reusability in life science is impacted by many factors. In particular, the availability of the code or software in one hand, and of the data in the other, is a key component of being able to reuse the research and replicate the results. 
In this collaborative exercise, you will try to have a first assessment of how the availability of code and data has evolved in the last 12 years in a specific domain of cognitive neuroscience (memory studied with fMRI).

To do this, you will try to sample the literature in this specific domain (defined by the pubmed query below) and estimate for a number of articles the availability of code and data. Often, it will not be easy to determine from the publication if the code is really available, or if the data is truly accessible.  

## Pubmed query: 
(fMRI[Title/Abstract]) AND (memory[Title/Abstract] AND n-back)
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%28fMRI%5BTitle%2FAbstract%5D%29+AND+%28memory%5BTitle%2FAbstract%5D+AND+n-back%29

## The goals of this assignment are to:
1) Make you aware of the level of reusability of the literature in this specific domain
2) Get some experience with a collaborative work using Git

## Constraints: 
- The time spent on this assignment should not exceed the normal amount of hours spent on an assignment.
- Procedure, code, results should be pushed to the [Github](https://github.com/QLS600/) organization. You may reuse the assignment repository if you wish. 
- Discussions / organization can happen on a slack space or using GitHub issues but should be open to all students and myself.

## Presentation:
On Thursday March 10th, the class will be presenting the results. 
I suggest to present the work with the following sections:  

- Design of the study (~15mn) 
- Protocol for data acquisition, how was the work organized across students (~15mn)
- Analysis of results and conclusions (~15mn)

## Personnel feedback
In addition, each student should write a paragraph to give some feedback on their personal experience (difficulties, lessons learnt, etc). Please email me the paragraph by March 18th.

## Other
A few students asked to finish a specific reproducibility project. This project also needs to be presented (10-15mn) on March 10th.
